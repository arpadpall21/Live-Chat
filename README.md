# Websocket Demo
Peer-to-peer communication through websocket connection
- this chat implementation is far from being perfect, but more than enough to show how powerful JavaScript websocket implementation is

## JavaScript
- run `npm install` to install the necessary packages
- run `node server.js` first then `node client.js` to establish the websocket connection
- modify files in the `/peers` directory to send/receive messages to/from the other pair
